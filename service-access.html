              <h3>Remote Access</h3>
              <p>As remote work and cross-organizational collaboration become increasingly common, accessing internal
                resources from external locations and networks has become a fundamental requirement for business
                development. However, traditional VPN solutions present numerous limitations and issues. VPNs are
                difficult to use and manage, lack scalability and agility, offer a subpar user experience, are not
                privacy-friendly, and introduce security risks at the network level.</p>
              <p>SupraAXES Secure Workspace can serve as a solution for remote access, enabling employees or partners to
                access necessary internal resources anytime, anywhere. In comparison to VPNs, SupraAXES Secure Workspace
                offers significant advantages:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Users can access internal resources without the need to install a client or perform specific
                  configurations on their endpoint devices.</li>
                <li>Easy to manage, maintain, and scale, allowing for the addition or removal of users/resources and
                  adjustment of access policies as needed.</li>
                <li>Built on a zero-trust architecture, safeguarding the underlying network and granting access based on
                  dynamic, session-specific policies.</li>
                <li>Enables granular control, offers comprehensive login and access logs, and can fully record all user
                  activities.</li>

              <h3>Multi-branch Access</h3>
              <p>As businesses scale and organizations expand, internal resources will progressively be dispersed across
                multiple branch locations in different regions. To facilitate business growth, companies often resort to
                establishing proprietary networks on wide area networks, enduring high costs, low flexibility, and
                intricate management.</p>
              <p>SupraAXES Secure Workspace adopts a distributed cloud-native architecture, offering a simple, flexible,
                cost-effective, and easily scalable Multi-branch Access solution. It supports access to various internal
                resources across multiple branch locations, authorizing user access through dynamic policies, and
                allowing deployment of one or more user access points based on business requirements.</p>

              <h3>Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)</h3>
              <p>As the business model of public cloud services becomes widely accepted, the number of cloud services
                used within enterprises and organizations is increasing. The user base is also becoming more diverse in
                terms of numbers and origins. Managing and allocating different users' cloud service accounts,
                controlling users' usage of cloud services, and preventing the leakage of critical data within cloud
                services have become important challenges.</p>
              <p>SupraAXES Secure Workspace can provide comprehensive Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) services,
                supporting various cloud services as resource access points. It allows centralized management of
                individual user accounts and enterprise shared accounts, enabling the implementation of granular dynamic
                access policies to comprehensively manage user usage of various cloud services. SupraAXES Secure
                Workspace supports users accessing relevant cloud services anytime, anywhere using various endpoint
                devices, retains comprehensive access logs and operation records, and effectively prevents data leakage.

              <h3>Privileged Account Management(PAM)</h3>
              <p>Due to the nature of their roles, different business departments commonly maintain various shared
                accounts across internal business systems, third-party partner platforms, external service websites, and
                diverse cloud service providers. These accounts are typically overseen and utilized by the respective
                business heads, operating with limited controls in day-to-day usage. Transitioning ownership of these
                accounts during changes in business leadership can be quite challenging. Moreover, these accounts are
                often prime targets for hacker attacks and unauthorized access, with breaches or misuse frequently going
                undetected in a timely manner.</p>
              <p>Through SupraAXES Secure Workspace, controlled usage of shared accounts can be achieved. The passwords
                for each shared account are managed by the system administrator and are not disclosed to the actual
                users of the accounts. Detailed usage information of shared accounts can be recorded, and fine-grained
                control can be applied when users are using shared accounts, including recording all user actions and
                even capturing video footage throughout the process.</p>

              <h3>Remote Broser Isolation (RBI)</h3>
              <p>Organizations are increasingly providing more business systems to users in the form of web
                applications, making 'everything on the web' a trend in the development of business applications. On the
                other hand, web security issues are widespread, with web vulnerability analysis tools and various attack
                techniques rapidly evolving, leading to a high level of activity in attacks targeting web applications.
                To protect critical web applications, especially to enhance the protection of important data, businesses
                and organizations need to manage and monitor users' browser configurations and access behaviors. At the
                same time, users continue to face various web security threats from the open network, as advanced hacker
                attacks often target users as entry points to penetrate enterprise and organizational core business
                systems, steal important data, or cause damage.</p>
              <p>The remote browser service provided by SupraAXES Secure Workspace offers a comprehensive solution. When
                using the remote browser service, users will receive an instantly generated isolated browser environment
                from SupraAXES Secure Workspace to access various target applications. Users can directly use their
                local terminal device's browser to obtain the rendering images of the isolated browser and interact with
                it, without the need to install any client software, browser plugins, or perform any specific
                configurations. Once the user finishes using the remote browser service of SupraAXES Secure Workspace,
                the corresponding isolated browser environment will be destroyed and released.</p> 
              <p>Businesses and organizations can restrict users to only access important web applications through
                remote browser services, fundamentally preventing malicious users from collecting application
                information and launching attacks, and eliminating data leaks. Correspondingly, to prevent users from
                becoming victims of hacker attacks and attack vectors, users can be required to access public networks
                or suspicious sites only through remote browser services.</p>

              <h3>Public Access for Isolated Network</h3>
              <p>In many key industries, core business operations need to be completed within an internal network
                isolated from the public network. With the further development of business, internal personnel often
                need to access the public network to query and retrieve relevant information. However, due to the
                restrictions of network isolation, they can only do so by entering specialized physical shuttle areas,
                which is inconvenient and leads to low work efficiency.</p>
              <p></p>SupraAXES Secure Workspace offers a novel solution to this challenge. Through SupraAXES Secure
              Workspace, internal users can directly access public resources within the internal isolated network.
              Administrators can exercise granular control, providing public resources to users as needed based on
              dynamic access policies. Furthermore, detailed access logs and even operation records of internal users
              can be retained, all without concerns about hacker infiltration and data leaks.</p>
