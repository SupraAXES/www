              <h3>Shifting Paradigm in Resource Access Management:</h3>
              <h3>From "Get User In" to "Send Resource Out" </h3>
              <p>In the evolving landscape of resource access management, businesses are increasingly recognizing the
                limitations of traditional access models and are adopting more sophisticated strategies. One such
                strategy is the shift from the "get user in" model, which focuses on securely bringing users in to
                aceess resources, to the "send resource out" model, which emphasizes delivering resources to users in a
                controlled and secure manner. Here we are going to explore this paradigm shift and introduce Resource
                Projection, an innovative approach for the "send resource out" model.</p>
              <h5>"Get User In": The Challenges with Proxies and Gateways</h5>
              <p>Historically, organizations have relied on proxies and gateways to manage access to resources following
                the “get user in” model. This traditional approach, centered around creating a secure perimeter and
                managing access through controlled points, primarily focuses on ensuring that users are secure when they
                access resources, and is increasingly facing significant challenges.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <h6>Technological Complexity</h6>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Resource Diversity.</strong> Managing diverse resource types, each with unique access
                      requirements and protocols, has become increasingly complex for gateways and proxies. This
                      complexity often leads to inefficient access management, impacting user experience and operational
                      efficiency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Encryption Challenges.</strong> With the rise of encryption to protect data transfers,
                      traditional gateways and proxies often struggle to effectively intercept and inspect encrypted
                      traffic. This limitation not only hampers thorough security inspections but also complicates
                      adherence to stringent security policies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Outdated Resource Links.</strong> Users often face issues with outdated or invalid links
                      when accessing resources through gateways or proxies. These issues arise from static addresses or
                      settings embedded in resources, leading to access errors and reduced productivity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compatibility Issues.</strong> Discrepancies in the capabilities and requirements of
                      user endpoints, the proxies or gateways, or target resources often lead to compatibility problems,
                      degrading user experience and increasing support costs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability Issues.</strong> The traditional model with proxies and gateways struggle to
                      scale efficiently as organizations grow, and the increasing number of devices and services
                      exacerbates the complexity and cost of maintaining such secure access points.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h6>Management Overhead</h6>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Resource-Intensive Operations.</strong> Gateways and proxies demands significant
                      management efforts, requiring continual updates and configurations to align with new security
                      policies and network changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of Visibility.</strong> The traditional “get user in” model often suffer from
                      limited visibility into network traffic and user activities. This limitation not only poses
                      challenges in detecting anomalies or malicious behavior, especially within encrypted or complex
                      traffic flows, but also hinders the auditing and forensic analysis of user activities.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h6>Increased Risk of Data Exposure</h6>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Endpoint Vulnerability.</strong> The traditional “get user in” model inherently exposes
                      data at user endpoints, which may be compromised, and increases the risk of data interception by
                      malicious actors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Insider Threats.</strong> The risk of insider threats is inevitable in the “get user in”
                      model. Malicious insiders can exploit their access to sensitive data, potentially leading to
                      significant data breaches.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h5>"Send Resource Out" with Resource Projection</h5>
              <p>Rather than connecting users directly to target resources, the "send resource out" model focuses on
                securely delivering the resources to the users, and Resource Projection represents a transformative
                approach for resource access management. </p>
              <p><img src="assets/images/technologies/projection.png" alt="" class="bg-black" /></p>
              <p>By streaming only the graphical or textual user interface of resources, Resource Projection offers a
                sophisticated solution for accessing digital assets without a direct connection. Resource Projection
                normalizes resources of different types and enables seamless interaction, ensuring both efficiency and
                security, and offers several compelling advantages:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <h6>Unified User Interface</h6>
                  <p>Resource Projection provides a standardized user interface across different resource types,
                    enhancing user experience and reducing training and support costs.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h6>Seamless User Interaction</h6>
                  <p>Unlike the traditional “get user in” model that might require users to navigate complex VPNs or
                    remote desktop environments, Resource Projection allows for a real-time, interactive experience
                    streamed directly to the user’s device. This method minimizes latency and maximizes efficiency
                    without compromising data security.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h6>Advanced Security Measures</h6>
                  <p>By isolating users from direct access to target resources, Resource Projection significantly
                    reduces the risk of cyber threats. A user realizes interaction only on the projection of a
                    resource’s user interface and can never directly access the raw data, effectively reducing the
                    potential attack vectors and fundmentally improving data security.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h6>Comprehensive Administrative Control</h6>
                  <p>Administrators can enforce security policies and controls remotely, ensuring that all interactions
                    comply with organizational standards without impacting the endpoint's integrity. This is
                    particularly valuable in environments where endpoint security cannot be guaranteed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h6>Auditing and Compliance</h6>
                  <p>Every interaction through Resource Projection is logged and can be audited, providing a transparent
                    and accountable method for monitoring user activities. This is crucial for compliance with stringent
                    data protection regulations and for conducting detailed forensic investigations.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>The strategic evolution from "get user in" to "send resource out" with Resource Projection is more than
                a trend—it represents a fundamental shift in how organizations manage and secure access to digital
                assets. By reducing the attack surface, simplifying user access, and enhancing security, Resource
                Projection offers a visionary solution that addresses the inherent weaknesses of traditional “get user
                in” model. As digital landscapes become increasingly complex and security becomes more paramount,
                embracing such innovative access strategies will be crucial for organizations striving to protect their
                resources while maintaining operational agility and compliance.</p>
