              <h3>Working Portal</h3>
              <p>Employees use a variety of business-related resources in their daily work, including various internal
                business systems, cloud services, hosts, and servers. However, with numerous business-related resources,
                users find it challenging to understand, use, and manage them. The process of setting up accounts,
                authorizations, and clearance for the multitude of resources and applications is complex, often leading
                to omissions or errors.</p>
              <p>SupraAXES Secure Workspace can provide a unified Working Portal, supporting users in accessing all
                office resources in one place.</p>
              <p>Deploying SupraAXES Secure Workspace also includes the following effects:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>accessing resources through SupraAXES Secure Workspace do not need to log in again, and they cannot
                  obtain sensitive information such as account credentials and passwords related to the resources.</li>
                <li>Secure Workspace can provide comprehensive user login and resource access logs, records of user
                  actions when accessing resources, and even full video recordings.</li>
                <li>With SupraAXES Secure Workspace, administrators can centrally manage users, resources, and access
                  permissions separately.</li>
                <li>When permissions expire or are removed from SupraAXES Secure Workspace, users immediately lose
                  access to office resources.</li>

              <h3>Data Protection</h3>
              <p>Data has become the core of businesses and organizations, and the protection of data in daily
                management faces increasing challenges: on one hand, there is a need to prevent malicious infiltration
                and attacks by hackers or external forces, aiming to steal and disrupt data; on the other hand, there is
                a need to prevent data leaks caused by malicious actions or negligence from internal personnel.
                Traditional data security solutions mainly fall into two categories: managing and monitoring data flow,
                or strengthening the management of user endpoint devices. However, in the practical application within
                businesses and organizations, both of these types of data security solutions can significantly impact
                users' daily work habits and efficiency, and the effectiveness of data protection is also relatively
                limited.</p>
              <p>SupraAXES Secure Workspace offers a novel solution - to instantly create a dynamically and exclusive
                secure workspace for users.</p>
              <p>While maintaining users' work habits and efficiency unchanged and providing significant convenience for
                their daily work, SupraAXES Secure Workspace can rigorously control and supervise users' access to
                various business-related resources. This prevents users from directly accessing business data and
                eliminates the landing of business data on user endpoints, thereby offering comprehensive and thorough
                protection for business data.</p>

              <h3>Endpoint Security</h3>

              <p>
                To prevent the spread of harm caused by infected endpoint devices and to protect data on office devices,
                enterprises and organizations need to continuously strengthen control over endpoint devices. However,
                traditional Endpoint Security measures often rely on endpoint management and security software clients,
                and the various security capabilities they claim are often difficult to implement in practical
                applications:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Compatibility issues. Enterprises and organizations typically have various types, models, and
                  versions of endpoint devices from different manufacturers, and endpoint management and security
                  software clients often cannot be compatible with all devices. On the other hand, the business
                  applications or personal software commonly used on endpoint devices often conflict with endpoint
                  management and security software clients.</li>
                <li>Difficult to manage daily. Upgrading endpoint management and security software clients on numerous
                  user endpoint devices requires a significant amount of manpower and time. To ensure that business
                  management and security policies continue to be effective on user endpoint devices, management
                  personnel need to continuously monitor and address various endpoint software and hardware
                  configuration and compatibility issues that users encounter.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>SupraAXES Secure Workspace provides a comprehensive solution that allows users to work on endpoint
                devices without installing endpoint management and security software clients or performing specialized
                configurations.</p>
              <p>Through SupraAXES Secure Workspace, users directly access and operate holographic projections of
                work-related resources, while business-related data and files do not land or leave traces on user
                endpoint devices. Additionally, SupraAXES Secure Workspace can prevent malicious software or hackers
                from penetrating internal networks through users' endpoint devices, fundamentally ensuring the network
                security and data security of enterprises and organizations.</p>

              <h3>Bring-You-Own-Device(BYOD)</h3>
              <p>More and more users are using their own devices to handle work-related tasks, which not only enhances
                work efficiency and response speed but also brings many challenges to enterprises and organizations. On
                one hand, various endpoint control measures for network security and data confidentiality are difficult
                to implement on users' personal devices. On the other hand, work-related applications and data heavily
                consume and deplete resources on user devices, and work-related controls may significantly invade user
                privacy.</p>
              <p>SupraAXES Secure Workspace provides a comprehensive solution that can prevent malicious software or
                hackers from infiltrating internal networks through users' endpoint devices and can avoid office-related
                data remaining on user endpoint devices, effectively preventing data leaks. Additionally, SupraAXES
                Secure Workspace supports users in working with various endpoint devices without the need to install
                clients or work applications, consuming minimal endpoint resources, not affecting users' daily
                entertainment or personal tasks, and enabling administrators to configure strict resource access
                policies based on the attributes and current status of endpoint devices.</p>
